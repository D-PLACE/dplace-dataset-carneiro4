See Gamble [?]; The neighboring Mandinka use the hoe but their productivity is not as high as the Wolof, who simply plant without loosening the soil -- this reduces soil erosion, helps maintain nutrients and eliminates certain diseases which are related to not planting early enough (e.g. the Rozette disease among the Mandinka). The Wolof techniques requires some weeding + they have developed an ingenious tool (xiler) for this (See Ames 1959)",
