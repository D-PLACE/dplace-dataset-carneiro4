002,0,Musil 1928: 90-93,"The Rwala do not themselves engage in cultivation, of course, but the cultivation of others provides a substantial part of their ""subsistence"", if you mean literally food: according to Musil (1928: 90-93), they consume a substantial amount of wheat or millet.",

020,0,,"(-); This is a little difficult to be clear about in regard to the Rwala camel pastoralists. Musil and others (e.g. Raswan) have commented on the meager diet and persistent hunger of the Bedouin, especially the ""poor Bedouin."" Ups and downs of hunger seem to go with the milk supply, and that varies with the pasturage. Camel meat is eaten, but not as a staple of the diet. Nevertheless, the herds are large and camels that pass into the hands of the merchants become meat or work camels in the towns, especially in Egypt. Milking camels are never sold, however, but may be loaned to others who are short in supply (this is probably true of the Rwala, though I don't recall that Musil says so; it is true of all other Bedouin on whom there is such information.) Moreover, the section and tribal herds (special herds under the care of the chiefs) as well as the chief's herds are a ""surplus"". But I don't think the Rwala are explicitly aware of producing a food surplus, either for their own security or for the non-RwaIa settled populations. Perhaps their ""surplus"" is really an ""obligatory margin""! In their camps, however, they support a few non-Rwala, such as the blacksmiths, and are usually/always able to support guests and despoiled kinsmen for a time.",
021,0,,"(-); Can grazing territories and sectional camel herds be equated with granaries? Seems borderline, in the direction of, etc. Certainly, when a desert emirate appears, supported by the Bedouin tribes, the emir maintains a store of supplies to support his army. The Rwala chief (of tribe or of section, but functioning primarily in relation to the section or segment) maintains a commonly owned herd. The information is not clear or complete on this; there are just hints.",

084,1,,"(+); According to Musil's observations, members of the chiefly family of the segment he moved with owned property in date palm groves and received a share of the harvest; this is the Rwala; I now am unable to locate his observation (I think it is in one of the geographical tomes, not Manner and Customs); this ownership was ""family"" property. For the Nejd Shammar, Montagne has said that the sections or segments owned such property, and the chief received and distributed the harvest. This is or seems to be distinct from tribute relations with cultivator settlements. Would you hold camel and sheep equivalent to land as property? The Rwala are distinguished as the wealthiest as well as the most powerful of the north Arabian Bedouin; they probably held more than twenty camels per tent, on the average; Shaykh owned some 200 milking camels.",
085,0,,"Would camel brands, indicated clan segment, lineage, family serve as a property record. They identify animals for the Bedouin, in part, at least.
