They are certainly twice the size that the family needs for itself, but there is no separate structure. I do not believe that the farinha roasting sheds of today were aboriginal, and the great size (permanent for the duration of the girls’ term of office) of the vute family houses must also be questioned. The rectangular houses are not aboriginal but are a 19th C. adaptation. Presumably, the houses earlier were round and small. I do not think we know their size.",

For instance, the Ramkokamekra-Canela may trade with the Apanyekra-Canela for arara feathers and chalk, and farinha or anything else. In the 19th C. they were hostile and unfriendly to the Apanyekra. They had no tamhak (visiting-privilege chief) in each others tribes so they could not have gone into each others villages easily. The Ramkokamekra were friendly with the Cakomekra and must have traded minimally with them for rare decorative artifacts. These tribes were aboriginally, politically and economically independent and self sufficient. They contacted each other to fight blood revenge skirmishes and for control of favorable parcels of land, and also for minimal non-sustenance trading. Even now they do not trade regularly with the local Brazilians because they have so little to trade. In the first part of the 20th C. it is known that they traded farinha and sweet potato flour to the local Brazilians for axes, machetes, and cloth quite regularly. Then they were economically on their feet; 2. I think you want a (-) score because you are scoring for the aboriginal set-up and for a significant economic relationship which they did not have. They did have some minimal non-subsistence inter-community tradings, I think, at least it is most reasonable to believe so.",

In a council meetings, no one must sit behind him but they are not strict about this. Again, it is a question of degree – minimal in this case. Leaders march behind their troops. Maybe you can remove the question mark.",

We know that friendly tribes appointed and ceremonially established, in the other tribe, a particular person who would act as their protector, supplier, and representative should they come visiting. And it is evident that they did do some visiting. I do not know if you can use the words ""treaty"", “witnessed” or “sworn”, but you can say that formal inter-tribe relationships were established through rites and that the consequent visiting rights, protocol, and patterns was quite well defined. I think that a (+) is consistent with the intent of your question. Members of both tribes witnessed the performance of the rite of making a tamhak.",

It is just that it is informal, inconsistent, personal, and flexible. How would you score it?; (they are not specified, they are just known by all)",
