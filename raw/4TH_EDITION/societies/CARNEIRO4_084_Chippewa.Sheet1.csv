086,0,,"There is the possibility that there was a give-away of personal possessions to guests invited by relatives of the deceased to funeral rites. These guests may have been outside the unilineal descent group which was the local group. Thus, the notion of transmission of goods through inheritance in sensu stricto may not apply. I really have very little data on the whole question except that in later historical times the give-away was employed and the gens took considerable interest in funerary affairs. I should perhaps answer the question with a question-mark",

214,0,,"There is precious little material on pre-contact warfare. The weight of evidence (perhaps I should say of speculation) would be against much warfare besides feuding. However, without wishing to moralize, even feuding may have had an underlying economic function, for instance, the maintenance of physical distance between communities to obviate territorial competition. Therefore I qualify this answer by saying there is no evidence for demonstrable economic motivation for warfare",
215,0,,"This I answer with a minus, even though very soon after contact, say by the 1650’s, there appear to have been prominent warriors, or war leaders. These probably arose as a result of specific conflicts with the Iroquois which were strictly a post-contact development. Again, as in the case of question 214, I would qualify my answer by indicating that the weight of evidence would indicate no war leadership on any formal basis before contact",

236,1,,"?; This is a real poser, and my plus answer would seem to contradict answers to previous questions on warfare. Although warfare was not a major pursuit for the pre-contact Chippewa it would, I believe, be wrong to assume that there was no conflict at all. The history of war trophies in the woodlands seems to reach back to such an early period I could not discount the possibility that such trophies as scalps could be found among the early Chippewa. However, this is a highly speculative plus",
